**The NCATSTranslator Org has an Announcements Project Board linked to the following org repos. Purpose of this project board is to provide a centralized location for important  deadlines, milestones, reminders and announcement pertaining to the whole Tranlsator consortium in a single easily accessible location. Additional repos should be linked to this project board as needed:**
- [TranslatorPM](https://github.com/NCATSTranslator/TranslatorPM/issues)
- Committees
  - [Translator Architecture](https://github.com/NCATSTranslator/TranslatorArchitecture/issues)
- Working Groups
  - [ReasonerAPI (TRAPI)](https://github.com/NCATSTranslator/ReasonerAPI/issues)
  - [User-Centered-Working-Group](https://github.com/NCATSTranslator/User-Centered-Working-Group/issues)
  - [Evidence-Provenance-Confidence-Working-Group](https://github.com/NCATSTranslator/Evidence-Provenance-Confidence-Working-Group/issues)
  - [Operations-and-Workflow](https://github.com/NCATSTranslator/OperationsAndWorkflows/issues)
- Registry-related
  - [translator_extensions](https://github.com/NCATSTranslator/translator_extensions/issues)
  - [Knowledge_Graph_Exchange_Registry](https://github.com/NCATSTranslator/Knowledge_Graph_Exchange_Registry)
- [SRI Governance](https://github.com/NCATSTranslator/SRIGovernance)

**Announcements can be added to the board in two ways:**
1. You may add an announcement directly on the board by clicking '+' in the column and adding a _Note_
   - TIP: Notes cards do not allow for notifications, labels or assignments 
   
2. An announcement can be added by creating an issue in the appropriate repo. If you aren't sure which one, please add the issue to [TranslatorPM](https://github.com/NCATSTranslator/TranslatorPM/issues)
   - In the TranslatorPM repo (or another appropriate repo) add labels to the issue that you need to link to the Announcements project board: announcement, [committee or working group], [team]
   - After adding the appropriate labels to the issue, in the Projects pane select the Announcements project.
   - It may ask you to "Triage" the issue, if that is the case, select the appropriate column on the project board.
   - Additionally, if you would like to notify a specific committee(s), working group(s), or project team(s), include @ncatstranslator[insert GitHub team here] in the text of the issue.
   - Finally, review the project board to make sure the issue that you added to the board appears in the corrcet column. If your issue does not appear:
     - Click '+ Add cards'
     - Search to find your card
     - Drag it to the appropriate Column
 _Note:_ Issues created in a repo outside of NCATSTranslator Org can still be added to the Announcement project board. To add an issue to the Announcements project board, create a card and type/paste in the issue url the _card add text section._ This way the issue will be on the project board as a to-do item and help us with overall effort to stay informed of tasks and related progress. 

**General Guidelines:**
- Issues without due dates will be removed from the board (but can still be in the repo) after 1 week
- Gazette and Relay reminders may stay on the board longer
- Recap Announcements will be included on the board
- Committee and WGs moderators/PMs should consider adding their announcements to their repo, then adding the announcements to the board following their meetings.
