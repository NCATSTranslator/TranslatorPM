The NCATSTranslator Org has an Announcements Project Board linked to the following org repos [additional repos should be added as needed]:

- TranslatorPM
- Committees
  - Translator Architecture
- Working Groups
  - ReasonerAPI (TRAPI)
  - User-Centered-Working-Group
  - Evidence-Provenance-Confidence-Working-Group
  - Operations-and-Workflow
- Registry-related
  - translator_extensions
  - Knowledge_Graph_Exchange_Registry
- SRI Governance

Announcements can be added to the board two ways:
1. Directly on the board by clicking '+' in the column and adding a Note
   - Notes do not allow for notifications, labels or assignments 
2. Creating an issue in the appropriate repo (if you aren't sure which one, please add to Translator PM)
   - In the Translator PM repo add labels for:  announcement, [committee or working group], [team]
   - After creating the issue, in the Projects pane on the right, select the Announcements Project
   - It may ask you to "Triage" the issue, if that is the case, select the appropriate column 
   - From the issue, click on the Announcements link the project pane
3. If you would like to notify a specific committee(s), working group(s), or project team(s), include @ncatstranslator[insert GitHub team here] in the text of the issue
   - Does not work in Notes
4. Review the board, if your issue does not appear:
   - Click '+ Add cards'
   - Search to find your card
   - Drag it to the appropriate Column
   
General Guidelines:
- Issues without due dates will be removed from the board (but can still be in the repo) after 1 week
- Gazette and Relay reminders may stay on the board longer
- Recap Announcements will be included on the board
- Committee and WGs moderaters/PMs should consider adding their announcements to their repo and adding the announcements to the board following their meetings
