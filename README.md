# TranslatorPM

The issues in this repo are activities related to the integrated project management for Translator in order to realize the vision of Translator and transition to a working platform that serves as a resource to the translational research community.

The current critical path for Translator targets a (soft) Production release to NCATS Hosting by December 2021.  This will be an iterative, joint process.  Teams will continue to develop and enahnce tools independently while also working toward the shared goal of an enterprise-quality Translator.

An overview of the timelines is:
- **Translator Dev Components Hosted or SLAs in Place By:**  April 15, 2021
  - **TRAPI v1.1 Fully Implemented By:** April 30, 2021
- **Translator Prod Components Hosted or SLAs in Place By:**  August 27, 2021
- **Translator Prod Demo Ready By:** November 1, 2021

As such, the expectations for Translator components are scoped as follows:

- All Agents are expected to be contributing ARS actors in the prod environment
- All "primary" Providers are expected to be contributing in the prod environment (either directly with the ARS if TRAPI compliant, or via Agents)
- Provider teams may decide to "opt-out" their "secondary" KPs are under development, or not used by ARAs
- Shared components - as depedencies necessitate

Currently we are working on identifying Federated Dev Instances (docs/Translator Server Info.md)
